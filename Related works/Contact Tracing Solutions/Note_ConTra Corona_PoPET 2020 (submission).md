# Key points
* only **pseudorandom warning identities (wid)** are published
* **Sybil attacks** can be effectively mitigated
* false positive and false negative (suppressing warnings)
* side-channel (the timing of Bluetooth beacons) -> adding timing jitter

# Notes
* [ROBERT](https://github.com/ROBERT-proximity-tracing/documents) and [NTK](https://github.com/pepp-pt/pepp-pt-documentation/blob/master/PEPP-PT-high-level-overview.pdf) proposed by PEPP-PT
* **Privacy**: limiting disclosure of information about participating individuals; **Security**: limiting malicious users' abilities to produce false positives and false negatives
* About Sybil Attacks
    * Paparazzi Attack: collect tokens with an antenna, once the target is diagnosed, get at-risk message and know who is infected
        -> paparazzi + sybil = tracking multiple users' health status
    * Nerd Attack: log information when contact with someone
        -> nerd + sybil = tracking multiple uesrs' health status
    * Militia Attack: sold lots of information to a militia which could threaten sick people and force them to isolate in an asylum
