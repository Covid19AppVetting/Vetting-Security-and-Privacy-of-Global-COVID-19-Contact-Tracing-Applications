# Contact-Tracing-Apps

The rapid spread of COVID-19 has made traditional manual contacttracing to identify potential persons in close physical proximity toan known infected person challenging. Hence, a number of publichealth authorities have experimented with automated contact trac-ing apps. While the global deployment of contact tracing apps aimsto protect the health of citizens, these apps have raised security andprivacy concerns. 

In this project, we assess the security and privacyof 34 exemplar contact tracing apps using three methodologies:
1. evaluate the design paradigms and the privacy protections pro-vided; 
2. static analysis to discover potential vulnerabilities anddata flows to identify potential leaks of private data; 
3. evalu-ate the robustness of privacy protection approaches. 

Based on theresults, we propose a venue-access-based contact tracing solution,VenueTrace, which preserves user privacy while enabling proximitycontact tracing. 

We hope that our systematic assessment resultsand concrete recommendations can contribute to the developmentand deployment of applications against COVID-19 and help gov-ernments and application development industry build secure andprivacy-preserving contract tracing applications; a vital tool againstfighting the pandemic.
